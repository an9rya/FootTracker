        <h2>Food Waste:</h2>
        <p>An average Canadian household generates <em>140 kg</em> of food waste per year. This is equivalent to <em>56.6</em> tonnes of CO2</p>
        <p>However, <em>60</em>% of this is avoidable through sustainable practices such as donating, proper storage, and avoiding overbuying.</p>
        <p>In Canada, <em>4.82</em> million tonnes of food are lost in processing and manufacturing.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Plastic Waste:</h2>
        <p>The average Canadian will produce about <em>105</em> kg of plastic waste each year, <em>37</em>% coming from packaging.</p>
        <p>A majority of Canadians already practice sustainable methods to reduce plastic waste such as reusable water bottles and bags.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>Electric Waste:</h2>
        <p>In 2019, the annual electricity consumption per Canadian household was <em>15</em> megawatt-hours.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, <em>81</em>% of Canadian households employ some form of energy-saving lighting.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>Transportation Waste:</h2>

        <p>The average vehicle mileage per year in Canada is <em>15200 km</em> and the average distance travelled by a passenger is <em>2182 km</em> by plane.</p>
        <p>In just September 2022, <em>120.6</em> million trips were taken in Canadian transit, saving <em>2.2</em> tonnes per person overall.</p>
        <p>Only roughly a third of employed Canadians use sustainable methods of transportation.</p>
        <p>In 2021, <em>5.3</em>% of registered Canadian vehicles were electric or hybrid.</p>
